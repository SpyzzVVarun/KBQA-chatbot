Research Interest:
Semiconductor optoelectronics, Quantum Emitters, Strain(op)tronics, Integrated photonics, 2D materials &amp; heterostructures Our lab&#39;s research focuses on providing optoelectronic solutions for a wide range of applications, spanning diverse areas such as quantum technology, telecommunications, diagnostics in medicine, and sensors for extreme environments. In our nano-optoelectronics lab, we explore the fundamental aspects of understanding and controlling light-matter interaction for various low-dimensional solid-state systems and unlock their immense potential for next-generation nano-optoelectronics. Furthermore, our research aims to harness the novel quantum and optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials specifically 2D materials and their heterostructures to develop compact, energy-efficient, and ultra-fast optoelectronic devices, including detectors, modulators, and emitters, in order to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of nanoscale optoelectronics.&nbsp;
