Research Interest:
Quantum materials, Semiconductors, Epitaxial thin films, Nanowires, Spintronics, Optoelectronicsswitching, Spin orbit torque, Non-collinear spin textures.&nbsp; Research in our group is especially associated with the preparation of high-quality Quantum Materials to understand &nbsp;the fundamental physics behind the diverse emergent phenomena. Quantum materials is a vibrant research area in conjunction with &nbsp;condensed matter physics and materials science that can no longer be explained by the classical or semiclassical treatment. &nbsp;Our group extensively explores such materials to unveil the fascinating low dimensional physics such as phase coherent quantum transport, &nbsp;quantum confinement effect for energy saving spintronics, optoelectronics and quantum computing applications. &nbsp;Thereby our research paves a path for mankind to possess technologically advanced and comfortable lifestyle. &nbsp; &nbsp;
