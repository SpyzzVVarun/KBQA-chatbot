Research Interest:
Nanomaterials, Single Crystals, Perovskites, Photophysics, DFT, Opto-electronic Devices, Bioimaging Our research focus is primarily on solution processed growth of nanocrystals, single crystals, inorganic metal-chalcogenide quantum dots, low dimensional perovskite analogues and corresponding theoretical crystal studies. Employment of these novel solution processed semiconductor layers as an active material in different opto-electronic devices in emerging technologies for light-emitting devices (LEDs), solar cells, photo-detectors, and other device applications.
